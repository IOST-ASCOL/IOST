# Rust Repository

## Overview
This repository contains Rust code demonstrating various functionalities. Each file contains examples with clear comments to help you understand different Rust concepts. Follow the instructions below to set up the project and run the code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, fork this repository, and then clone it to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd Rust/Basics
```
Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY-NAME` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

### 2. Install Rust
Make sure Rust is installed on your local machine. You can install it using the [Rust official documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Follow these steps to set up Rust:
1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

If you're using Windows, you can also download the Rust installer from the same link.

### 3. Run the Rust Files
The code in this repository is organized for step-by-step execution and exploration of Rust concepts. Each file contains commented examples that you can uncomment and run.

To run a Rust file, navigate to its directory and use the following command:
```bash
cargo run --bin file_name
```
Replace `file_name` with the actual name of the file you want to execute. For example:
```bash
cargo run --bin hello_world
```

If using a standalone `.rs` file (without Cargo):
```bash
rustc file_name.rs
./file_name
```

### Important Notes
1. **Follow the Order**: The examples in the repository are organized in a specific sequence, building from basic to advanced concepts. It is recommended to execute them in order.
2. **Use a Code Editor**: For easier editing and running of the code, you can use an editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with Rust support (via plugins like the `rust-analyzer` extension).
3. **Understand the Concepts**: Each file includes comments explaining the relevant Rust concepts, such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and more.

### Example Workflow
1. Navigate to the desired Rust file in your editor.
2. Review the examples and uncomment the code blocks you wish to execute.
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin file_name
   ```
4. Observe the output in the terminal.
