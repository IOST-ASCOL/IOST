# JavaScript Repository
## Overview
This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating various functionalities. The code is provided in commented blocks, which you can uncomment and execute block by block for a better understanding.
Follow the instructions below to set up the project and run the code.
## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
First, fork this repository, and then clone it to your local system:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd JavaScript
```
Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY-NAME` with your GitHub username and the repository name.
### 2. Install Node.js
Make sure Node.js is installed on your local machine. You can install it using the [Node.js official documentation]().
### 3. Run the JavaScript Files
The code in this repository is organized into **commented blocks**. Uncomment the code block you want to run step by step.
- **For Windows users**: Use `Ctrl + /` to uncomment code.
- **For Mac users**: Use `Cmd + /` to uncomment code.

Once the desired block is uncommented, you can execute the file using Node.js with the following command:
``` bash
node fileName.js
```
Replace `fileName.js` with the actual name of the file you want to run.
### Important Notes
1. **Follow the Order**: The files and blocks are designed to be executed in a particular order. Uncomment the code sequentially to avoid any errors.
2. **Use a Code Editor**: For easier editing and running of the code, you can use an editor like [Visual Studio Code]() or [WebStorm]().

### Example Workflow

1. Navigate to the desired JavaScript file in your editor.
2. Uncomment the code block you want to execute.
3. Run the command:
``` bash
node example.js
```
1. Check the terminal/output for results.
